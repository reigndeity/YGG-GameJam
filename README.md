# TECHNICAL STACK FOR KUSINERO
### Game Engine:
- **Unity**: A powerful cross-platform game engine used for creating 2D and 3D games. It provides a robust ecosystem for game development with features like physics simulation, real-time rendering, animation systems, and asset management.
- **Version**: Unity 2022.3.37f1

### Programming Language:
- **C#**: The primary scripting language for Unity. It is used to develop game mechanics, manage game objects, and implement custom functionalities.
- **IDE**: Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code for efficient code editing and debugging.

### Graphics and Rendering:
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Used Built-in Render Pipeline, Unity’s default render pipeline.
- **Post-Processing**: Effects like Bloom, Motion Blur, Depth of Field, and Color Grading to enhance visual appeal.

### 3D Modeling and Animation:
- **3D Assets**: Blender and Substance Painter. Imported into Unity via FBX formats.
- **Animation**: Blender’s default features for the Rigging, and Animation.
- **Physics Simulation**: Rigidbodies, Colliders, and Unity’s built-in physics engine for realistic interactions and behaviors.

### Audio System
- **Audio Integration**: Unity's AudioSource and AudioMixer components for managing game sound effects and music.
- **Audio Manipulation**: Audacity to mix and cut audio.

### User Interface (UI)
- **UI Framework**: Unity UI (uGUI) system for creating in-game menus, HUDs, and user interfaces.
- **Interaction**: Custom scripts for handling UI interactions, transitions, and animations.

### Performance Optimization
- **Memory Management**: Asset bundling, pooling techniques, and garbage collection optimization to ensure smooth gameplay.
- **Profiling Tools**: Unity Profiler to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
- **3D Models Quality**: Use of Low-Poly Modeling techniques to reduce in-scene polycount counts and improve overall game performance.

### Version Control
- **Repository**: Git for version control with GitHub.
- **Collaboration**: Use of Git LFS (Large File Storage) for handling large assets and seamless collaboration among team members.

### Platforms and Hardware
- **Platforms**: PC Standalone.
- **Hardware**: Requires the use of gamepad controllers.

# ON-CHAIN PROPOSAL
### Our Party Game Rewards System
Our party game introduces an engaging rewards system where players earn points based on their performance in matches. Here's how it works:

#### **1. Points System**
- After each game, players will be awarded points that correspond to their ranking in the match. Higher placements will earn more points, incentivizing players to compete and improve their gameplay.

#### **2. Using Points to Purchase Chef Card Packs**
- The points players accumulate can be saved and used to purchase **Chef Card Packs**. These packs operate on a gacha-based system, adding an element of excitement as players open them to reveal Chef Cards of varying rarities, similar to how pokemon cards operate.
- **Chef Cards as NFTs**: Each Chef Card revealed from a pack is minted as an NFT. The rarity of the Chef Card affects its value, with more rare cards being more desirable and valuable. This rarity system creates a collectible and tradeable ecosystem within the game.

#### **3. Real-World Value and Marketplace**
- **Card Values**: Because Chef Cards are NFTs, they have corresponding values in real-world currency. Players can capitalize on their in-game achievements by trading or selling these cards.
- **In-Game Marketplace**: We will implement an in-game marketplace similar to the CS2 market on Steam, where players can use real money to buy or trade in-game items. Players can list their cards for sale, set prices, and purchase cards from other players, creating a dynamic economy. This marketplace aims to ensure that players have a secure and transparent platform to engage in transactions, with the potential to earn real-world profits.

# Roadmap for On-Chain Integration
#### **1. Initial Setup and Smart Contract Development**
- Develop and deploy the core NFT smart contracts.
- Implement basic trading features and in-game wallet integration.

#### **2. Asset Creation and Decentralized Storage**
- Tokenize key in-game assets.
- Create a user-friendly interface for players to interact with their assets.

#### **3. Marketplace and Collaborative Game Modes**
- Launch the decentralized in-game marketplace.
- Develop and deploy smart contracts for onlione multiplayer, ensuring secure and efficient mechanics.

#### **4. Testing and Optimization**
- Conduct extensive testing on a blockchain testnet.
- Optimize gas fees and user experience before mainnet deployment.
